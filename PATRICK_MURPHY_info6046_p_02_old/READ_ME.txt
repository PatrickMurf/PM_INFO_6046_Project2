=== Build/Run:
-> To build & run the project, run the .sln file, and click "Local Windows Debugger".


=== Controls:
The controls should be fairly intuitive...Mainly because the program displays them, & can remind you at any time.  Regardless, here's a quick rundown & explanation for what isn't as easily explained.

-> The help menu shows up when the project is first loaded; and can be brought up again with 'P'.  It will explain your controls to you.
-> 'O' will show you the current settings for volume, & pitch.

-> Number keys 1 through 3 will play a sound.  (Try to avoid having more than 1 sound at a time.)
-> 'Q' will toggle if the sound is played/paused.  (Requires a sound currently active.)
-> 'W' will immediately end a sound from playing.  (Requires a sound currently active.)

-> 'Z' and 'X' control the volume.  You cannot change these without an active sound.
-> 'C' and 'V' control the pitch.  You cannot change these without an active sound.
-> Finally, 'M' will restore to defaults.
